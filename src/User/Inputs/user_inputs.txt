*ensure that: *all* battlefield branding is removed( there cannot be a conflict/copy-protected materials, etc.), we will generate our own assets to add' to the platform later., 
& lets start a "Chat_BTC" "Leaderboard(s)" & play it with a similar-to battlefield-style( for example, *EVERY USER* (everyone must "sign-up" in order to participate) on the platform, etc. & the following applies to *ALL* users on the platform participating to *roll* dice *every* *single* submission (unless opt-out) ;
1: a user submits a query which automatically rolls dice every single submission( this is done in the background as to not interfere with what users are doing),
 2: when the dice are "rolled" several events occur;
 all players randomly have a chance(25% chance to: attack another player) take a "turn" to roll the dice against a randomly selected participant. 
whoever is closest to the "Jackpot-numbers" will get to "draw" a "player-card" ( cards have various bonuses, traits, specials, btc, crypto, moves, attacks, perks(*all* perks are member-lifetime & ARE *EXTREMELY-RARE*[jackpots are still much bigger & harder to receive], "player-cards" can *ONLY* be earned from: playing the game in chats & contributing to the platform, & from "trading"/"purchasing" it from other players or @ the Chat_BTC store where it can be bought or sold for btc, canto, usd, euro, etc. or stored in a user(s) "vault"/Converted to an "NFT" on the "Canto-Network" only.)
\\
 3: every attack would play-out like this per turn: user submits query: (25%-chance of  initiating attack with dice roll) chance to: "hit" another player with a "long-shot"[long-range -5% damage], "ricochet"[- 5% damage, has a chance to "miss"(20%), "very-rare" chance of "critical-hit" ] "Lucky-Shot"[critical +5% damage], "Direct-Hit" [target becomes winded (-5% accuracy)], "limbs"(critical hits here can cause a number of status-effects like: slow-moves=-7.3% evasion, "crippled-status": -user skips the next 2 turns, etc.),
\\
**given the context above, the description of the game & platform i am describing must be very consistent and mindful of *all* users & rules of the platform, please '"analyze"' this 3 or more times to get the desired outcome of my inputs, & <'enrich', 'extend', 'expand', 'enhance', & 'improve'> *greatly* & *exhaustively* upon all aspercts of this & the platform, etc.**
some adjustments: "player-cards" are *only* to be given by chance, *no one* can receive a player card by just playing the game.,
the dice should be 10,000-sided dice to be more "fair" & "balanced",
Jackpots yield Cash/Crypto rewards,'create' some unique & *real* ways we can generate revenue to accumulate jackpots for players by meeting a quota(include daily jackpot vs: weekly/monthly jackpot)
'Create' another reward-system that: '"Rewards"' players/users for '"contributing"' to the "chatbot_models" knowledgebases & data_sources/overall-intelligence items, artifacts, etc. (*3 "Chat_BTC_Artifact" creations[which cannot be triggered by users, these are rare and valuable responses based on user submissions] will reward the user with a "Special" query, & with : ChatBTC_Tokens, & Canto_Tokens*) -summary: free rewards for participating in the chat_platform & contributing data/knowledge.;
